# BudgetApp

The Budget App takes an input from the user for the monthly budget.
Then it takes input from the user for the item and the amount spent respectively.
It keeps a list of all the items bought and deducts the amount from the monthly budget and shows how much is left.
The color also changes when the amount becomes less than a certain limit.
